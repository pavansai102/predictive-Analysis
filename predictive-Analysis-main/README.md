💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predictive analysis using machine learning to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
The model is trained on a real-world dataset containing anonymized transaction features and classifies each transaction as fraudulent or legitimate.

This project was completed as part of Internship Task-2: Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning.

🎯 Objective

Build a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions

Perform data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation

Analyze model performance using appropriate metrics

📊 Dataset Description

Source: Credit Card Transactions Dataset

Total Features: 30

Time – Time elapsed between transactions

V1 to V28 – PCA transformed features

Amount – Transaction amount

Class – Target variable

0 → Normal transaction

1 → Fraud transaction

⚠️ The dataset is highly imbalanced, with very few fraud cases.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Loading

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning (handling missing values)

Feature Selection

Feature Scaling using StandardScaler

Train-Test Split with Stratified Sampling

Model Training (Logistic Regression)

Model Evaluation

Fraud Prediction

🧠 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

Reason:

Efficient for binary classification

Performs well on PCA-transformed features

Easy to interpret

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Since the dataset is imbalanced, precision and recall are more important than accuracy.

🧪 Sample Prediction

The trained model can predict whether a new transaction is:

✅ Normal

🚨 Fraudulent
